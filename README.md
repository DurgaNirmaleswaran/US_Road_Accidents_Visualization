# US Road Accidents Visualization


This project is an interactive web-based dashboard designed to visualize road accident trends across the United States from 2016 to 2023. The dashboard includes three key visualizations:

- Top 10 States by Total Accidents  
- Yearly Trend of Accidents by Severity  
- Accident Severity by Road Feature

These visualizations are created using D3.js, with the data preprocessed using Python. The dataset is sourced from the publicly available [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) on Kaggle.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Required Python Packages

Before running the data cleaning script, make sure you have the required packages installed:


    pip install pandas 
    pip install kagglehub 

Using a virtual environment is recommended to avoid conflicts with system-wide packages.

### Step 2: Generate Cleaned Data
Run the data cleaning script to download the dataset, filter relevant columns, and output a JSON file used by the D3.js dashboard:

python scripts/dataCleaning.py <br>

This will create data/accidents_cleaned.json containing up to 100,000 rows for development.

### Running the Dashboard

To view the dashboard in a browser, you can use Live Server in VS Code or any local HTTP server.

### Option 1: Using Live Server (Recommended)
    1) Open the project folder in VS Code 
    2) Open index.html 
    3) Right-click and choose "Open with Live Server" 
### Option 2: Using Python HTTP Server 
If you donâ€™t have Live Server:

From the project root <br>
python3 -m http.server <br>
Then visit http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser. <br>
